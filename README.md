  <h2>Advancing Microplastics and Nanoplastics Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    At SEALLC, we provide specialized technical, analytical, and training services focused on microplastics and nanoplastics in environmental and biological samples.
    Our mission is to empower water and wastewater utilities, research groups, and analytical laboratories with the tools and expertise needed to accurately detect,
    quantify, and reduce microplastic pollution.
  </p>
  <p>
    By combining advanced analytical methodologies, consulting support, and partnerships with trusted laboratories,
    we deliver high-quality data and practical solutions that improve treatment efficiency and strengthen environmental stewardship.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    With more than a decade of academic research in microplastics and emerging chemicals of concern, we witnessed firsthand the growing challenges faced by industry,
    water utilities, and regulators in addressing microplastic pollution and its impacts on water and food safety.
  </p>
  <p>
    As regulatory interest intensified and the demand for reliable analytical methods increased, it became clear that a gap existed between cutting-edge scientific
    research and the practical tools available to environmental professionals.
  </p>
  <p>
    SEALLC was founded to bridge that gap by delivering scientifically rigorous, transparent, and actionable solutions that support informed decision-making,
    regulatory readiness, and environmental protection.
